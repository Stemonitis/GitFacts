search for the total repository count
{
    javascript : search(query: "archived:false", type: REPOSITORY) {
      repositoryCount
    }
    
    search(query: "archived:true", type: REPOSITORY) {
      repositoryCount
  }
  }

language field does give back the primary repository language, sometimes the
language does not get detected and in that case it is null
for example {
    search(query: "language:", type: REPOSITORY, first: 10) {
      repositoryCount
    }
  }
  result
  {
    "data": {
      "search": {
        "repositoryCount": 244827
      }
    }
  }


The weird thing is that when you put language:other by itself it gives zero results, but if you pair it with
something else in the query it just ignores it and goes with the other query. In general if the language entered
is not valid search just ignores the query


1)fetch the total count of the repositories

""+search word or if the string is empty
search for the total repository count run this and get the end result
{
    javascript : search(query: "archived:false", type: REPOSITORY) {
      repositoryCount
    }
    
    search(query: "archived:true", type: REPOSITORY) {
      repositoryCount
  }
  }

Not optional ones

1)Search by language
#list of all the github languages
#https://github.com/github/linguist 
#https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml



2) Repository size default three calls: 0 to 50KB, 50 to 1 MB  and more than 1MB = default check box. Or
if not default you can have a plus buttton that gives you three options, more than, less than and also option
to choose from kilobytes to negabytes to gigabytes. You also have to make sure that it is inclusive. Maybe its
better to make it in the form of a slider when you can add additional ones or optimal ones in the form of the 
gistogram. Like every three or for times so you have to prefetch the data from the smallest and the largest 
repository first.
+"size:<50"+"size:50...1000"+"size>=1000"


2)Number of stars
"stars:n"

3)Search by when a repository was last created
created:YYYY-MM-DD



##optional number of contributors
